    <p class="txtInBox">My name is HÃ¥vard Tonning. I have been the group leader for this project and have therefore been responsible for making sure that everyone knows what to do and how to do it. In addition to this, I made the Snakehole game. I am double-majoring in Cos and Inf, so this project has been a fun test of my capabitities, deploying both HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
    <br><br>
    In my spare time when I'm not doing schoolwork (so about 5 minutes a week), I enjoy climbing, hiking, biking, kayaking, photography and gardening.

    <p class="txtInBox">My name is Salome Menabde. I am doing a double major in Business and Journalism. I decided to take Website Development as a JMC elective and also because I wanted to try my hand at coding. My favorite subject has always been math, but I also enjoyed implementing creativity in my everyday life by writing. I decided to concentrate on Marketing to combine my technical and creative sides. My other hobbies are listening to music, baking, and playing piano and ukulele.
        I am not experienced in coding, but I still wanted to try doing the video game, so I picked a simpler one, Tic-Tac-Toe. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and different tutorials and articles to build my version for the game. For me, JavaScript was a challenge, but I made a simple version with the help of video tutorials and websites. The process was tough but also very fun in the end because of the excitement I felt when the game was working.</p>

        Hello, my name is Kamen. I am a sophomore and am majoring in Business Management and Information Systems. While I like gaining knowledge and experience in my academic studies I have my guilty pleasures in playing video games and overall procrastinating by doing nothing. My hobbies include going out for walks in the city, cooking and playing the piano from time to time. I consider myself a motivated person only when what I am doing is something I like and enjoy.

        In this project my work was on the development of the Trivia Game. The game includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript as development languages. For the basis of the project I used an existing one I found on the internet and had to change the CSS and HTML which was the easy process. What has a great challenge to me was the addition of a scoring system to the JavaScript, but eventually the work was done successfully little minor bugs. The project was overall enjoyable, because it was something new and useful as its difficulty provoked some creativity and research on new concepts for me.</p>
