Theme for website:
For our website, we wanted to create three different games that the user can play. This was chosen as it seemed like a challenge that would also be rewarding. We had to do a lot of the learning on our own, as this goes outside the scope of the course, but this leaves us with valueable skills. It also seemed like a good choice as it will make the presentation stand out among all the other presentations.

Style of website:
We wanted the website to have a feeling of a playful arcade while also remaining clean and stylish. 
We ended up giving it a subtle ombre from pastel purple to pastel pink. The home page has a nice graphic that fits with the aestetic of the page and shows in just one image what the site is all about.

Process:
After deciding what the theme for the website would be, we each found what game we would make: Salome - TicTacToe, Kamen - Trivia, and Håvard - Snake. 

One of the problems of the project, was that we were not able to get to the last person of the group. We sent email and messages on Canvas and figured that he would respond eventually. We therefore delegated the HTML of the home and about us page to him. When we were all done with our games and it became clear that there was no hope of getting to him, we split the remaining work among the three members. This led to more work and annoyance for us all, but this was better than leaving the site unfinished. For full transparancy - the layout of the about us page is adapted from that of Håvard's individual project, saving us some work.

Thoughts:
The project was not without it difficulties - both in the coding part and the whole 25% of the group missing thing. But looking back at these bumps in the road and seeing what we managed to create together, we are very proud.
