For this project I made my own version of snake. The code is based on a YouTube video by Kenny Yip Coding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baBq5GAL0_U&ab_channel=KennyYipCoding

Even though the game is based on that code, I have added a lot of functionality myself to make the game more responsive and fun. The code from the video makes up about 150 lines of code, while the remaining 200 are purely mine. 

This was a fun and challenging task. I do have some C++ knowledge, but none in JS, so the first thing I had to do, was learn how the language works. Once that was done, I had a blast coming up with creative solutions to the maky problems that arose.
